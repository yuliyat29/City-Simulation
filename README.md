---------------------------------------
This project is a dynamic city simulation that models urban development and resource management, built using JavaScript, MongoDB, and Java. The goal is to provide users with an interactive platform to visualize city growth, manage infrastructure, and simulate economic activities.


Features

Urban Development Simulation: Visualize city growth and resource allocation in real-time.
Infrastructure Management: Control city infrastructure, including transportation, utilities, and zoning.
Economic Simulation: Model the city's economic activities and observe impacts on growth.
Key Highlights

Efficient Data Handling: Uses MongoDB for fast and reliable data storage.
Interactive Design: A user-friendly interface powered by JavaScript for seamless interaction.
Robust Logic: Backend simulation logic developed in Java to handle complex scenarios.
